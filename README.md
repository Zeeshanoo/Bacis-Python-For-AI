### Speed Control

The `speed_control` function checks a driver's speed and issues penalties accordingly. It demonstrates basic conditional statements in Python.

### Dictionary Examples

Various examples showcase the usage of dictionaries in Python, covering topics like modifying values, deleting key-value pairs, and working with empty dictionaries.

### Class and Object (OOP)

The `Std` class represents a basic student object with attributes like name, father's name, contact number, and email. This demonstrates the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python.

### Data Structures

The code includes examples of working with different data structures like dictionaries, lists, and sets. It covers aspects such as iterating through dictionary items and using the `set` function.
